Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


Abstract

   The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to
   collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from
   operational networks.  To analyze these traces, it is necessary to
   split potentially large traces into more manageable pieces that make
   it easier to deal with large data sets and simplify the analysis of
   the data.

   This document provides some common definitions that have been found
   useful for implementing tools to support trace analysis.  This
   document mainly serves as a reference for the definitions underlying
   these tools and it is not meant to explain all the motivation and
   reasoning behind the definitions.  Some of this background
   information can be found in other research papers.

1.  Introduction

   The Simple Network Management Protocol (SMMP) was introduced in the
   late 1980s.  Since then, several protocol changes have taken place,
   which have eventually led to what is known today as the SNMP version
   3 framework (SNMPv3) [RFC3410][RFC3411].  Extensive use of SNMP has
   led to significant practical experience by both network operators and
   researchers.  However, up until now only little research has been
   done on characterizing and modeling SNMP traffic.

   Since recently, network researchers are in the possession of network
   traces, including SNMP traces captured on operational networks.  The
   availability of SNMP traces enables research on characterizing and
   modeling real world SNMP traffic.  However, experience with SNMP
   traces has shown that the traces must be large enough in order to
   make proper observations.  A more detailed motivation for collecting
   SNMP traces and guidelines on how to capture SNMP traces can be found
   in [ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE].

   Unfortunately, the analysis of large SNMP traces can take a large
   amount of processing time.  Therefore, it is often desirable to focus
   the analysis on smaller, relevant sections of a trace.  This in turn
   requires a proper way to identify these smaller sections of a trace.
   This document describes a number of identifiable sections within a
   trace which make specific research on these smaller sections more
   practical.  The following figure shows the various sections of traces
   and how they relate to each other.

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


   This document defines the various entities (boxes) shown in the above
   figure.  These definitions can be implemented by tools that can split
   SNMP traces into smaller sections for further analysis.

   The most central entity in the figure above is an SNMP trace,
   consisting of a potentially large set of SNMP messages.  An SNMP
   trace is the result of recording SNMP traffic on a specific network
   for a specific time duration.  Such a trace may, depending on the
   number of hosts in the respective network, contain SNMP messages
   exchanged between possibly many different SNMP engines.  The messages
   contained in a trace may be represented in different formats.  For
   the purpose of this document, the simple comma separated values (CSV)
   format defined in [ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE] contains sufficient
   information to split a trace into smaller sections.

   The SNMP messages belonging to an SNMP trace may have been exchanged
   between many different SNMP engines running on different hosts.
   Therefore, a first obvious way of separating a trace into smaller
   sets of SNMP messages is the separation of a trace into flows.  Each
   flow contains only those SNMP messages of an SNMP trace that have
   been exchanged between two network endpoints.  Such a separation may
   be necessary in case one wants to analyze specific SNMP traffic
   characteristics (e.g., number of agents managed by a management
   station) and wants to rule out network endpoint specific behaviour
   (e.g., different SNMP management stations may have different polling
   configurations).

   Flows within traces can still be quite large in terms of the number
   of messages they contain.  Therefore, it may be necessary to split a
   flow into even smaller sections called slices.  A slice contains all
   SNMP messages of a given flow that are related to each other in time
   and referenced information.  Splitting a flow into slices makes it
   possible to separate SNMP messages within traces that belong to each
   other.

   For example, a slice may contain the exchanged SNMP messages between
   an agent and a manager, which polls that agent in a single polling
   instance.  The manager may be configured to poll that agent every
   once in a while.  If the requested information from the agent remains
   unchanged, then the respective slices of SNMP traffic occurring
   between this manager and agent will be highly comparable.  In such a
   case the slices will be of the same slice type.  Similar slices will
   thus be considered of the same slice type and incomparable slices
   will not be of the same slice type.

   Besides the fact that each slice is of specific slice type, slices
   can also be of a specific form with respect to the messages
   encompassing a slice.  For example, slices containing a sequence of

   linked GetNext or GetBulk requests are commonly called an SNMP walk.
   Note that only a subset of all slices will be walks.

2.  Messages

   SNMP messages carry PDUs associated with well defined specific
   protocol operations [RFC3416].  The PDUs can be used to classify SNMP
   messages.  Following are a number of definitions that help to
   classify SNMP messages based on the PDU contained in them.  These
   definitions will be used later on in this document.

   Notation: Let M be an SNMP message.  The properties of M are denoted
   as follows:

      M.type    = operation type of message M (get, getnext, ...)
      M.class   = class of message M (according to RFC 3411)
      M.tsrc    = transport layer source endpoint of message M
      M.tdst    = transport layer destination endpoint of message M
      M.nsrc    = network layer source endpoint of message M
      M.ndst    = network layer destination endpoint of message M
      M.reqid   = request identifier of message M
      M.time    = capture timestamp of message M
      M.oids    = OIDs listed in varbind list of message M
      M.values  = values listed in varbind list of message M

   Note that the properties of a message can be easily extracted from
   the exchange formats defined in RFC XXXX [ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE].

   Definition (read request message): A read request message is a
   message M containing a PDU of type GetRequest, GetNextRequest, or
   GetBulkRequest.

   Definition (write request message): A write request message is a
   message M containing a PDU of type SetRequest.

   Definition (notification request message): A notification request
   message is a message M containing a PDU of type InformRequest.

   Definition (notification message): A notification message is a
   message M containing a PDU of type Trap or InformRequest.

   Definition (request message): A request message is a message M which
   is either a read request message, a write request message, or a
   notification request message.

   Definition (response message): A response message is a message M
   containing a PDU of type Response or of type Report.

   Note that Report messages are treated like Response messages since
   the SNMPv3 specifications currently use Report messages only as an
   error reporting mechanism, always triggered by the processing of some

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


   request messages.  In case future SNMP versions or extensions use
   Report messages without having a request triggering the generation of
   Report messages, the definition above may need to be revisted.

   Definition (non-response message): A non-response message is a
   message M which is either a read request message, a write request
   message, or a notification message.

   Definition (command message): A command message is a message M which
   is either a read request message or a write request message.

   Definition (command group messages): A set of command group messages
   consists of all messages M satisfying either of the following two
   conditions:

   (C1)   M is a command message

   (C2)   M is a response message and there exists a command message C
          such that the following holds:

             M.reqid = C.reqid
             M.tdst  = C.tsrc
             M.tsrc  = C.tdst
             (M.time - C.time) < t

   The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.

   This definition requires that the response message originates from
   the transport endpoint over which the request message has been
   received.  This is not strictly required by SNMP transport mappings
   and in particular the UDP transport mapping allows to send responses
   from different transport endpoints.  While sending response messages
   from a different transport endpoint is legal, it is also considered
   bad practice causing interoperability problems since some management
   systems do not accept such messages.

   It was decided to require matching transport endpoints since doing so
   significantly simplifies the procedures below and avoids accidentally
   confusing requests and responses.  Implementations responding from
   different transport endpoints will lead to (a) a larger number of
   requests without related responses (and likely no retries) and (b) a
   similarly large number of responses without a matching request.  If
   such behavior can be detected, the traces should be investigated and
   if needed the transport endpoints corrected.

   Definition (notification group messages): A set of notification group
   messages consists of all messages M satisfying either of the
   following two conditions:

   (N1)   M is a notification message

   (N2)   M is a response message and there exists a notification
          request message N such that the following holds:

             M.reqid = N.reqid
             M.tdst  = N.tsrc
             M.tsrc  = N.tdst
             (M.time - N.time) < t

   The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.

   We again require that the transport endpoints match for notification
   group messages.

3.  Traces

   Traces are (large) sets of SNMP messages that are the result of
   recording SNMP traffic using a single traffic recording unit (e.g.,
   using tcpdump) on a network segment carrying traffic of one or more
   managers and agents.  Traces being used in the remainder of this
   document may be altered as a result of anonymization, which may
   result in some message information loss.

   Definition (trace): An SNMP trace (or short "trace") T is an ordered
   set of zero or more SNMP messages M. All messages M in T are
   chronologically ordered according to the capture time stamp M.time.

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


4.  Flows

   Definition (flow): A flow F with parameter t is the set of messages
   of an SNMP trace T with the following properties:

   (F1)   All response messages originate from a single network
          endpoint.

   (F2)   All non-response messages originate from a single network
          endpoint.

   (F3)   All messages are either command group messages with parameter
          t or notification group messages with parameter t.

   Subsequently, we call flows containing only command group messages
   command flows.  Similarly, we call flows containing only notification
   group messages notification flows.

   Note that it is possible that response messages of a trace cannot be
   classified to belong to any flow.  This can happen if request
   messages triggering the response messages were not recorded (for
   example due to asymmetric routing) or because response messages were
   originating from transport endpoints different from the endpoint used
   to receive the associated request message.

   Definition (flow initiator): A flow initiator is the network endpoint
   of the two endpoints involved in a flow, which is responsible for
   sending the first non-response message.

   Notation: Let F be a flow as defined above.  We denote the properties
   of F as follows:

      F.type  = type of the flow F (command/notification)
      F.nsrc  = network layer source endpoint of F
      F.ndst  = network layer destination endpoint of F
      F.start = time stamp of the first message in F
      F.end   = time stamp of the last message in F
      F.t     = parameter t of F (maximum timeout for response messages)

   This definition of a flow is mostly consistent with the definition of
   a flow used in [SPHSM07].  The difference is that the tool used to
   generate the data reported in [SPHSM07] did only require that the
   network layer source endpoint of the response messages matches the
   destination network layer endpoint of the associated request
   messages.

5.  Slices

   Flows are made up of smaller sets of messages that are related to
   each other.  Such a subset of messages from a single flow will be
   considered a slice of a flow.

   Definition (slice): A slice S with parameter e is a subset of SNMP
   messages in a flow F for which the following properties hold:

   (S1)   All messages are exchanged between the same two transport
          endpoints (a single transport endpoint pair).

   (S2)   All non-response messages must have a PDU of the same type.

   (S3)   All messages with a PDU of type Get, Set, Trap, or Inform must
          contain the same set of OIDs.

   (S4)   Each GetNext or GetBulk message must either contain the same
          set of OIDs or they must be linked to the chronologically last
          response of the previous request, that is the request must
          contain at least one OID that has been contained in the
          (repeater) varbind list of the chronologically last response
          message of a previous request message.

   (S5)   All Response messages must follow a previous request message.

   (S6)   For any two subsequent request messages Q1 and Q2 with Q1.time
          < Q2.time, the following condition must hold:

               (Q2.time - Q1.time) < e

   The parameter e in S6 defines the maximum time between two non-
   response messages that belong to a slice.  This parameter should be
   chosen such that unrelated requests within a flow are not considered
   to be of the same slice.  Unrelated requests are those that, for
   instance, belong to different polling instances.  The parameter e
   should therefore be larger than the retransmission interval in order
   to keep retransmissions within a slice and smaller than the polling
   interval used by the slice initiator.

   Definition (slice initiator): A slice initiator is one of the two
   transport endpoints involved in a slice, which is responsible for
   sending the chronologically first non-response message.

   Notation: A slice S has several properties.  We introduce the
   following notation:

      S.type     = type of non-response messages in S
      S.tsrc     = transport layer endpoint of initiator of S
      S.tdst     = transport layer endpoint of non-initiator of S
      S.start    = time stamp of the chronologically first message in S
      S.end      = time stamp of the chronologically last message in S
      S.e        = parameter e of S (maximum time between two
                   non-response messages)

6.  Slice Prefix

   As noted in the beginning of this document, it is desired that slices
   can be tested for equality/comparability.  This is where the slice
   prefix comes in.  The slice prefix has as a sole purpose to provide
   one of the means to compare slices.  Using the slice prefix and a few
   other parameters (which will be discussed later on in this document)
   of a number of slices, one can determine which slices should be
   considered 'equal' and which of them are incomparable.  This will
   assist in the process of finding potentially other relations.

   The slice prefix is a set of OIDs.  This set is constructed from the
   messages that make up a single slice.  So, for example, a slice that
   is the result of a manager requesting the contents of a particular
   table (with OID alpha) on an agent using a simple single varbind
   GetNext walk, starting at the table OID alpha, shall yield a slice
   prefix which consists of the OID alpha.

   Because the aim is to compare various slices using the slice prefix
   (along some other characteristics of a slice), this implicitly
   suggests the need to know whether a number of slices are the result
   of the same behaviour (i.e., specific configuration) of the
   initiating party of these slices.  For example, one may want to know
   whether a number slices that involve a single manager and a single
   agent were the result of just one specific configuration of that
   manager.  Multiple slices, that may all be initiated by that same
   manager and each slice possibly occurred in different polling
   instances, may in fact be the result of the same specific
   configuration of that particular manager.  So, since in this case the
   specific configuration of the manager is only relevant for
   determining the behaviour, the slice prefix should be constructed
   based on OIDs in messages originating from that manager only.  More
   generally, only the messages within slices that are sent by the
   initiating party (the non-response messages) are considered for the
   determination of the respective slice prefix of a slice.

   The resulting set of OID prefixes will represent the behaviour of the
   respective initiating party of that slice.  This allows us to compare
   different slices.

   Following is a short introductory example which depicts what a slice
   could consist of and how one could determine the slice prefix in such
   a general case.

   Consider the case of a single manager A polling a specific agent B.
   More specifically, the manager A is configured to retrieve the
   complete contents of two columns alpha and beta of a some table.  The
   resulting slice may contain the following messages:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Message | Direction | PDU type        | OIDs
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
       0        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha, beta
       1        B -> A    Response          alpha.0, beta.0
       2        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.0, beta.0
       3        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1
       4        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.1, beta.1
       5        B -> A    Response          gamma.0, delta.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

   The manager starts with a GetNext request referencing two OIDs, alpha
   and beta.  The agent B replies in message 1 with the first items of
   each of the referenced columns.  The manager in turn goes on
   obtaining data from these two columns until it receives message 5,
   which indicates that the manager has received all of the data from
   the two columns.

   It can be easily concluded that the manager was configured to
   retrieve the contents of the two columns alpha and beta (the slice
   prefix).  A different slice involving the same manager and agent and
   that is again the result of the same configuration of the manager,
   should be considered 'equal' to this one because the two slices are
   the result of the same behaviour.  It should however be mentioned
   that such a second slice might contain a different number of
   messages, since the contents of the tables on the agent side might
   have changed over time.  This underlines the previously made remark
   that only the messages originating from the initiating party should
   be considered in this process, because they will (in such a scenario)
   always illustrate the same behaviour of the initiating party.

   The previous example now makes it possible to give a more formal
   definition of a slice prefix.  This is accomplished by first defining
   a slice signature which then leads to the definition of a slice
   prefix.

   Definition (slice signature): A slice signature S.sig of a slice S is
   a set of OIDs derived from the OIDs contained in the non-response
   messages of a slice.  This set S.sig consists of the following OIDs:












van den Broek, et al.  Expires September 10, 2008              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


   case S.type = GetNext or S.type = GetBulk:

        S.sig =       U    (N.oids)  -      U    (R.oids)
                    N in S                R in S
                N is non-response      R is response

   otherwise:

        S.sig =       U   (N.oids)
                    N in S
                N is non-response

   Definition (OID prefix): An OID a = a_1.a_2...a_n is a prefix of OID
   b = b_1.b_2...b_m if and only if

   (P1)   n < m and

   (P2)   a_i = b_i for 1 <= i <= n.

   Definition (slice prefix): The slice prefix S.slice is the set of all
   OIDs o in S.sig for which there is no p in S.sig such that p is a
   prefix of o.

   Following is an example to illustrate the definitions just described:
   Consider the case that a single manager A polling an agent B. More
   specifically, the manager A is programmed to retrieve the complete
   contents of two single column tables alpha and beta.  Besides that,
   the manager now also requests the sysUpTime in the first request the
   manager sends to B. A resulting slice may contain the following
   messages:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Message | Direction | PDU type        | OIDs
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
       0        A -> B    GetNext Request   sysUpTime, alpha, beta
       1        B -> A    Response          sysUpTime.0, alpha.0, beta.0
       2        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.0, beta.0
       3        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1
       4        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.1, beta.1
       5        B -> A    Response          gamma.0, delta.0
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

   The slice prefix is determined as follows:

   1.  The union of all OIDs in non-response messages is the following
       set:

          N = { sysUpTime, alpha, beta,



van den Broek, et al.  Expires September 10, 2008              [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


                alpha.1, beta.1, alpha.2, beta.2 }

   2.  The union of the OIDs in response messages is the the following
       set:

          R = { sysUpTime.0, alpha.1, beta.1,
                alpha.2, beta.2, gamma.1, delta.1 }

   3.  Substracting the two sets results in the slice signature S.sig:

          S.sig = N - R = { sysUpTime, alpha, beta }

   4.  Since none of the OIDs in S.sig is a prefix of any other OID in
       S.sig, the slice prefix is equal to the slice signature:

          S.prefix = { sysUpTime, alpha, beta }

   This set of OIDs describes the behavior of the initiating party of
   this particular slice.  Within the context of the described
   configuration of the initiating party is it apparent that a
   subsequent polling instance of the mentioned manager A polling agent
   B will result in the same slice signature.

   Following is a more elaborate slice for which the slice prefix is
   determined.  Consider again the case that a single manager A is set
   to poll a specific agent B. Manager A is programmed to retrieve some
   values from B. A single slice may contain the following messages:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Message | Direction | PDU type        | OIDs
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
       0        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha, beta
       1        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1
       2        A -> B    GetNext Request   alpha.1, beta.1
       3        B -> A    Response          alpha.2, beta.3
       4        A -> B    GetNext Request   beta.2, alpha.2,
                                            sysUpTime
       5        B -> A    Response          beta.3, alpha.3
                                            sysUpTime.0
       6        A -> B    GetNext Request   beta.3, alpha.3
       7        B -> A    Response          gamma.1, alpha.4
       8        A -> B    GetNext Response  alpha.4
       9        B -> A    Response          delta.1
    -------------------------------------------------------------------

   This slice has a number of interesting properties:





van den Broek, et al.  Expires September 10, 2008              [Page 16]

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


   o  Not all columns in the table have an equal length.

   o  The manager is set to request the sysUpTime on an irregular basis
      (i.e., every few requests).

   o  The manager attempts to 'fill' holes in the table.

   o  The order of referenced OIDs in GetNext messages changes.

   All of these properties do not influence the process for determining
   the slice signature.  The slice prefix is constructed as follows:

   1.  The union of all OIDs in non-response messages is the following
       set:

          N = { alpha, beta, alpha.1, beta.1,
                beta.2, alpha.2, sysUpTime, beta.3, alpha.3, alpha.4 }

   2.  The union of the OIDs in response messages is the the following
       set:

          R = { alpha.1, beta.1, alpha.2, beta.3, alpha.3,
                sysUpTime.0, gamma.1, alpha.4, delta.1 }

   3.  Substracting the two sets results in the slice signature S.sig:

          S.sig = N - R = { alpha, beta, beta.2, sysUpTime }

       The element beta.2 exists because the manager was trying to
       'fill' a 'hole' in a table.  Since these holes reside in the
       tables on the agent side and may change dynamically, they do not
       really help in describing the behavior of the initiating party.

   4.  Since beta is a prefix of beta.2, the slice prefix becomes the
       following set:

          S.prefix = { alpha, beta, sysUpTime }

       The slice prefix does not include beta.2 anymore and thus a
       manager retrieving the same columns alpha and beta with and
       without holes will produce slices with the same slice prefix.

   Finally, consider a slice where s.type is not GetBulk or GetNext.
   Manager A is programmed to poll some values from B. A single slice
   may contain the following messages:

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions          March 2008


    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Message | Direction | PDU type        | OIDs
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
       0        A -> B    Get Request       alpha.1, beta.1
       1        B -> A    Response          alpha.1, beta.1

   The slice prefix is determined as follows:

   1.  The slice signature is the union of all OIDs in non-response
       messages:

          S.sig = { alpha.1, beta.1 }

   2.  Since none of the OIDs in S.sig is a prefix of any other OID in
       S.sig, the slice prefix is equal to the slice signature:

          S.prefix = { alpha.1, beta.1 }

7.  Slice Type

   As described previously, the slice type allows for comparing slices.
   This means that any number of slices that are of the same slice type
   may be considered an equivalence class and may therefore be
   considered to be the result of the same behaviour of the slice
   initiator.

   Definition (slice equivalence): Two slices A and B satisfy the binary
   slice equivalence relation A ~ B if the following properties hold:

   (EQ1)   All messages in A and B have been exchanged between the same
           two network endpoints.

   (EQ2)   All read request messages, write request messages, and
           notification messages in A and B originate from the same
           network endpoint.

   (EQ3)   All non-response messages in A and B are of the same type.

   (EQ4)   The slices A and B have the same prefix, that is A.prefix =
           B.prefix.

   It can be easily seen that the relation ~ is reflexive, symmetric,
   and transitive and thus forms an equivalence relation between slices.

   Definition (slice type): Let S be a set of slices, then all slices in
   the equivalence class [A] = {s in S | s ~ A} with A in S, are of the
   same slice type.

8.  Walks

   Definition (walk): A walk W is a slice S with the following
   properties:

   (W1)   The type of the slice S is either GetNext request or GetBulk
          request.

   (W2)   At least one object identifier in the sequence of requests at
          the same varbind index must be increasing lexicographically
          while all object identifiers at the same varbind index have to
          be non-decreasing.

   Definition (strict walk): A walk W is a strict walk if all object
   identifiers in the sequence of requests at the same varbind index are
   strictly increasing lexicographically.  Furthermore, the object
   identifiers at the same index of a response and a subsequent request
   must be identical.

   Definition (prefix constrained walk): A walk W is a prefix
   constrained walk if all object identifiers at the same index have the
   same object identifier prefix.  This prefix is established by the
   first request within the walk.

9.  Concurrency

   Definition (concurrency): Two slices A and B of a given flow F are
   concurrent at time t if A.start <= t <= A.end and B.start <= t <=
   B.end.

   Definition (flow concurrency level): The concurrency level of a flow
   F at time t is given by the number of concurrent slices of F at time
   t.

   Definition (slice initiator concurrency level): The concurrency level
   of a slice initiator I at time t is given by the number of concurrent
   slices initiated by the slice initiator I at time t.

   Definition (overlapping): Two slices A and B of a given flow F are
   called overlapping if there exists a time t where A and B are
   concurrent.

   Definition (delta time serial): Two slices A and B of a given flow F
   with B.start > A.end are called delta time serial if (B.start -
   A.end) < delta.
