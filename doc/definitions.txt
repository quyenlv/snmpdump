Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions       November 2007


Abstract

   The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to
   collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) from
   operational networks.  To analyze these traces, it is necessary to
   split potentially large traces into more manageable pieces that also
   make it easier to deal with large data sets and simplify the analysis
   of the data.

   This document provides some common definitions that have been found
   useful for implementing tools to support trace analysis.  This
   document mainly serves as a reference for the the definitions
   underlying these tools and it is not meant to explain all the
   motivation and resoning behind the definitions.  Some of this
   background information can be found in other research papers.

Internet-Draft       SNMP Trace Analysis Definitions       November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Network Management Research Group (NMRG) started an activity to
   collect traces of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   [RFC3410] [RFC3411] from operational networks.  To analyze these
   traces, it is necessary to split potentially large traces into more
   manageable pieces that also make it easier to deal with large data
   sets and simplify the analysis of the data.

   This document provides some common definitions that have been found
   useful for implementing tools to support trace analysis.  This
   document mainly serves as a reference for the the definitions
   underlying these tools and it is not meant to explain all the
   motivation and resoning behind the definitions.  Some of this
   background information can be found in other research papers.

   More information and the motivation for SNMP trace collection and
   analysis can be found in RFC XXXX [ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE-01].

2.  Flows

   Notation: Let M be a message of an SNMP trace T. We denote the
   properties of M as follows:

      M.type    = operation type of message M (get, getnext, ...)
      M.class   = class of message M (according RFC 3411)
      M.tsrc    = transport layer source endpoint of message M
      M.tdst    = transport layer destination endpoint of message M
      M.nsrc    = network layer source endpoint of message M
      M.ndst    = network layer destination endpoint of message M
      M.reqid   = request identifier of message M
      M.time    = capture timestamp of message M

   Note that the properties of a message can be easily extracted from
   the exchange formats defined in RFC XXXX
   [ID-IRTF-NMRG-SNMP-MEASURE-01].

   Definition (command messages): The set of command messages of an SNMP
   trace T consists of all messages M in T satisfying the following
   conditions:

   (C1)   M is a Read class [RFC3411] message or

   (C2)   M is a Write class [RFC3411] messages or

   (C3)   M is a Response class [RFC3411] messages and there exists a
          Read class or Write class message R such that the following
          holds:

             M.reqid = R.reqid
             M.tdst  = R.tsrc
             M.nsrc  = R.ndst
             (M.time - R.time) < t

   The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.

   Definition (notification messages): The set of notification messages
   of an SNMP trace T consists of all messages M in T satisfying the
   following conditions:

   (N1)   M is a Notfication class [RFC3411] message or

   (N2)   M is a Response class [RFC3411] message and there exists a
          Notification class [RFC3411] message R such that the following
          holds:

             M.reqid = R.reqid
             M.tdst  = R.tsrc
             M.nsrc  = R.ndst
             (M.time - R.time) < t

   The parameter t defines a maximum timeout for response messages.

   Definition (flow): A flow F is the set of messages of an SNMP trace T
   with the following properties:

   (F1)   All messages belong to a single source and destination network
          address pair.

   (F2)   All messages are either command group messages, notification
          group messages, or internal group messages.

   (F3)   All Response class messages originate from a single network
          address.

   (F4)   All non-Response class messages originate from a single
          network address.

   Subsequently, we call flows containing command messages command
   flows.  Similarily, we call flows containing notification messages
   notification flows.

   Notation: Let F be a flow as defined above.  We denote the properties
   of F as follows:

      F.type  = type of the flow F (command/notification/internal flow)
      F.nsrc  = network layer source endpoint of F
      F.ndst  = network layer destination endpoint of F
      F.start = time stamp of the first message in F
      F.end   = time stamp of the last message in F

   This definition of a flow is consistent with the definition of a flow
   in the paper [SPHSM07].

3.  Flow Slices

   Definition (linked): A Response/GetNext or Response/GetBulk message
   pair is linked if the following holds:

   (L1)   The request message (GetNext or GetBulk) must contain at least
          one OID which has been contained in the (repeater) varbind
          list of the last response message of a previous request
          message.

   Definition (slice): A slice S is a subset of messages in a flow F for
   which the following properties hold:

   (S1)   All messages are exchanged between two transport endpoints (a
          single transport address pair).

   (S2)   All request messages must be of the same type.

   (S3)   All Get, Set, Trap, Inform messages must contain the same set
          of OIDs.

   (S4)   All Response messages must follow a previous request message
          that is part of the same slice.

   (S5)   All GetNext or GetBulk message must either contain the same
          set of OIDs or they must be linked to the last response of the
          previous request.

   (S6)   For a request message Q following the last response message R
          to the previous request, the condition (Q.time - R.time) < e
          is true.

   Notation: A slice S has several properties.  We introduce the
   following notation:

      S.type     = type of non-response messages in S
      S.start    = time stamp of the first message in S
      S.end      = time stamp of the last message in S
      S.prefix   = set of prefixes of messages in S /* [TODO] */

   Definition (concurrency): Two slides A and B of a given flow F are
   concurrent at time t if A.start <= t <= A.end and B.start <= t <=
   B.end.  The concurrency level F.clevel(t) of a flow F at time t is
   given by the number of concurrent slices of F at time t.  The
   concurrency level of a manager identified by the network address addr
   at time t is given by the sum of the flow currency levels F.clevel(t)
   for all flows originating from addr, that is F.nsrc = addr.

   Definition (delta time serial): Two slides A and B of a given flow F
   are called delta time serial if (B.start - A.end) < delta.

4.  Slice Sets

   Definition (slice type): A slice type is a type mark identifying
   slices that share the following properties:

   (ST1)   All messages have been exchanged between the same transport
           endpoints. (really transport? does this not break if a
           manager always changes its port number?)

   (ST2)   All READ, WRITE, NOTIFY messages originate from the same
           transport endpoint. (really transport???)

   (ST3)   All non-response messages are of the same type

   [TODO: Should this be an equivalence relation so that slice sets turn
   into equivalent classes?]

   Definition (slice set): A slice set is a set of slices that have the
   following properties:

   (SS1)   All READ, WRITE, NOTIFY messages originate from the same
           transport endpoint. (really transport???)

   (SS2)   ???

   (SS3)   All messages occurred within a specific time frame of each
           other. (what does this mean??? do we need delta serial for
           messages???)

5.  Walks

   Definition (walk): A walk W is a slice S with the following
   properties:

   (W1)   The type of the slice S is either get-next-request or get-
          bulk-request.

   (W2)   At least one object identifier in the sequence of requests at
          the same varbind index must be increasing lexicographically
          while all object identifiers at the same varbind index have to
          be non-decreasing.

   Definition (strict walk): A walk W is a strict walk if all object
   identifiers in the sequence of requests at the same varbind index are
   strictly increasing lexicographically.  Furthermore, the object
   identifiers at the same index of a response and a subsequent request
   must be identical.

   Definition (prefix constrained walk): A walk W is prefix constrained
   if all object identifiers at the same index have the same object
   identifier prefix.  This prefix is established by the first request
   within the walk.
