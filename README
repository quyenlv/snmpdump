= large file support on linux =

Linux per default seems to use 32bit offsets in file system calls. To
get support for 64bit files, you can do the following:

  $ getconf LFS_CFLAGS
  -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64

Adding the output of getconf to your compiler switches causes the C
library to replace all file system related calls with the 64bit
equivalents.
