.SH NAME
snmpdump \- extract SNMP messages from pcap trace files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snmpdump
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsnmpdump\fP extract SNMP messages out of pcap trace files and
renders the messages in an XML format which can be easily processed
using scripts written in scripting language such as Perl.
.PP
Data can be optionally anonymized by using the -a option. Note that
anonymization results can be drastically improved by loading the
relevant MIB modules using the -m flag. A default MIB module set can
be specified using the libsmi startup mechanism described in the
smi_config(3) man page.
.SH OPTIONS
\fBsnmpdump\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-anonymize
Anonymize the data. Setting this option will (a) anonymize all
recognized data types and (b) suppress all other data types. Loading
the MIB modules will generally improve the anonymization result.
.TP
\fB-c \fIfile\fB, --config=\fIfile\fP
Read \fIfile\fP instead of any other (global and user)
libsmi configuration file.
.TP
\fB-f \fIexpression\fB, --filter=\fIexpression\fP
Filter the input by applying the pcap filter \fIexpression\fR to the
packets before they are processed by snmpdump.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options.
.TP
\fB-m \fIfile\fB \-\-module \fIfile\fB
Load SMI MIB module definitions from \fIfile\fR.  This option can be
used several times to load several MIB modules into snmpdump.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Show version of program.
