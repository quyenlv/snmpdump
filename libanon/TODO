The function anon_key_set_passphase() seems to generate different keys
for the same passphrase, which is at least surprising.

The anon int64 and anon uint64 go into a loop if the number range is
too small. Perhaps the bounds should be optional in the first place?

Should the pcap_anon program not become a function of the anon
program, i.e. 'anon pcap [-hl] [-p passphrase] <file>'?

The manual page needs completion.

We might want to introduce global options to reduce the duplicated
code.  For example, the "-p passphrase" could be a global option and
we could pass down a suitable key to the cmd functions.
