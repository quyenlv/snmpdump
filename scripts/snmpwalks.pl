# This script tries to extract talbe walks out of CSV SNMP packet
# trace files. Optionally, detected walks are written into separate
# files in specified directory.
#

# A walk is defined as a series of get-next/response or
# get-bulk/response operations. A mixture of get-next and get-bulk
# requests is not considered a walk. Oids in the requests in the same
# varbind index (corresponding to the same table column) are
# increasing lexicographically and have the same oid prefix. This
# prefix is obtained from the first request within the walk. A request
# may have oid lexicographically lower than the one in previous
# response in case of table holes. A walk is ended if the
# lexicographical order is broken, i.e. the agent wraps back to the
# beginning of the table or the response contains a different oid
# prefix than the (initial) request for all varbinds (some columns may
# be shorter than others, but the walks ends when we reach the end of
# the longest column rather than the shortest one).

# WORKAROUNDS:

# net-snmp snmptable starts a bulk walk appending .0 to the table oid
# when using protocol version 2c. In order to detect walks properly,
# we strip off the trailing .0 and print a warning.

# BUGS:

# [P/A/Opaque] timestamps screw up duration calculations.

# Timeout not tested much.

# If we miss the first walk request, we probably miss also the oid
# prefix. We could figure out the prefix also later on during the walk
# by checking MIB information, but we're not doing it at the moment.

# We do not distinguish two concurrent walks for the same OID prefix.

# The above definition of a walk may miss some non-standard walks. It
# is questionabble whether these really should be considered walks.

# If columns are of different length and the agent would wrap back to
# the beginning of the table, we would probably notnotice the end of
# the walk.

# Receiving duplicated requests would probably screw up statistics.

# TODO:

# o sort table 1 by repetitions
# o cleanup code
# o don't dump walks with 1 interaction only
