This README gives an overview over the scripts that analyze trace
files and which are part of the software distribution. Note that most
scripts expect CSV format as input. Many scripts also accept gzip
compressed input files.

* snmpstats.pl

  Reads CSV input files and produces various basic statistics for the
  whole data set as output. The output format contains comment lines
  explaining the meaning of the data.

* snmpflowstats.pl

  Reads CSV input files representing individual flows. Flow files are
  typically generated using snmpdump's -F option. The script produces
  a table indicating the duration of the flows as well as the number
  of messages and bytes exchanged in the various flows.

* snmpwalks.pl

  Reads CSV input files and extracts information about walks found
  in the traces. We distinguish different types of walks. [xxx]

* snmpoidstats.pl

  Reads CSV input files and extracts information about the objects
  used in the traces. This scripts requires access to SMI object
  which are passed via the -m option in smidump -f identifiers format.

The following scripts post-process the output of the basic scripts
described above:

* snmpsizes.pl

  [xxx rename snmpsizes.pl to snmpplotsizes.pl? xxx]

How the scripts may play together:

  foo.csv --> snmpstats.pl --> "summary data"

  foo.csv --> snmpoidstats.pld --> "object/module usage data"

  [xxx]


=========

- Should there be a script to "normalize" time stamps?

- How to provide SMI information in a convenient way?

How to setup and use the SQL database:

1) mysqladmin create snmptrace

2) mysql snmptrace < sql/snmp_walk.sql
   mysql snmptrace < sql/snmp_walk_oid.sql

3) run the snmpwalks.pl script which produces an sql file 

   perl snmpwalks.pl -O foo.sql [-t window] foo.csv

   the scripts can create csv files for each walk if you
   specify an output directory using the -d option

4) mysql snmptrace < foo.sql

To access the database, you most likely need to pass -u <user> and
-p<password> to get prompted for the password. See the mysql
documentation for creating users and dealing with passwords and
access control.
