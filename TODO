TODOs:

- pcap-read.c sometimes writes to stdout where it should use stderr
- we should deal with opaque values correctly
- there should be a null anonymization transform
- anon.c should filter-out all message fields
- anon.c should read a config file which defines the filters to apply
- flow.c should garbage collect data and reorder output to ensure
  responses always follow the request
