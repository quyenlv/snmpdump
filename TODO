TODOs:

- we should deal with opaque values correctly
- anon.c should filter-out all message fields
- anon.c should read a config file which defines the filters to apply
- more regression tests for libanon
- add an option -z which causes snmpdump to gzip output files 
  automatically (may require changes to the internal output API)
- accept gzip'ed input for csv files (libxml does this already)
- hack pcap to support gzip'ed input and perhaps also mmap for plain
  input
