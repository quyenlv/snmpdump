The BER parsing code is taken from tcpdump's print-snmp.c module which

 *
 * This implementation has been influenced by the CMU SNMP release,
 * by Steve Waldbusser.  However, this shares no code with that system.
 * Additional ASN.1 insight gained from Marshall T. Rose's _The_Open_Book_.
 * Earlier forms of this implementation were derived and/or inspired by an
 * awk script originally written by C. Philip Wood of LANL (but later
 * heavily modified by John Robert LoVerso).  The copyright notice for
 * that work is preserved below, even though it may not rightly apply
 * to this file.
 *
 * Support for SNMPv2c/SNMPv3 and the ability to link the module against
 * the libsmi was added by J. Schoenwaelder, Copyright (c) 1999.
 *
 * This started out as a very simple program, but the incremental decoding
 * (into the BE structure) complicated things.
